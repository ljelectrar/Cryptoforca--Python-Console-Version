# "CRIPTOFORCA" or ENCRYPTED HANGAMN 

### MOTIVATION

"Cryptoforca" is one of my teaching resources. It brings to my classes a non-usual lesson dynamic, challenging my students with a simple hangman, however encrypted.

This class dynamic helped me to achieve high engagement with the students, especially those taking computing classes, and I always encourage them to try to develop or improve this project.

### DESCRIPTION

"Cryptoforca" is a simple hangman console that adds an encryption feature to challenge and teach computer students in my courses or courses that I teach or plan.
